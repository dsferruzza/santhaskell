===========

This is just a stupid, unfinished, toy project I worked on during a few days holidays.

## Install

- `cabal sandbox init`
- `cabal install --dependencies-only --enable-tests`
- `cabal configure --enable-tests`

## Usage

- create a directory named `output`
- create a file named `input.txt` containing one name per line
- run `cabal run`
